[Enter Orlando and Adam.]


ORLANDO  As I remember, Adam, it was upon this
fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand
crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on
his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he
keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that "keeping," for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their
feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that
end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain
nothing under him but growth, for the which his
animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives
me, the something that nature gave me his countenance
seems to take from me. He lets me feed with
his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as
much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the
spirit of my father, which I think is within me,
begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no
longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy
how to avoid it.

[Enter Oliver.]


ADAM  Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO  Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he
will shake me up.	[Adam steps aside.]

OLIVER  Now, sir, what make you here?

ORLANDO  Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.

OLIVER  What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO  Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that
which God made, a poor unworthy brother of
yours, with idleness.

OLIVER  Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught
awhile.

ORLANDO  Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with
them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I
