Scene 1
=======
[Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.]


KENT  I thought the King had more affected the Duke
of Albany than Cornwall.

GLOUCESTER  It did always seem so to us, but now in
the division of the kingdom, it appears not which
of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either's moiety.

KENT  Is not this your son, my lord?

GLOUCESTER  His breeding, sir, hath been at my
charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge
him that now I am brazed to 't.

KENT  I cannot conceive you.

GLOUCESTER  Sir, this young fellow's mother could,
whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,
sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband
for her bed. Do you smell a fault?

KENT  I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
being so proper.

GLOUCESTER  But I have a son, sir, by order of law,
some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in
my account. Though this knave came something
saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was
his mother fair, there was good sport at his making,
and the whoreson must be acknowledged.--Do you
know this noble gentleman, Edmund?

EDMUND  No, my lord.

GLOUCESTER  My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter
as my honorable friend.

EDMUND  My services to your Lordship.

KENT  I must love you and sue to know you better.

EDMUND  Sir, I shall study deserving.

GLOUCESTER  He hath been out nine years, and away he
shall again. [(Sennet.)] The King is coming.

[Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan,
Cordelia, and Attendants.]


LEAR
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,
Gloucester.

GLOUCESTER  I shall, my lord.	[He exits.]
