ACT 1
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Demetrius and Philo.]


PHILO
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gypsy's lust.

[Flourish. Enter Antony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train,
with Eunuchs fanning her.]

Look where they come.
Take but good note, and you shall see in him
The triple pillar of the world transformed
Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.

CLEOPATRA
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

ANTONY
There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.

CLEOPATRA
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

ANTONY
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new
Earth.

[Enter a Messenger.]
