ACT 1
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter King John, Queen Eleanor, Pembroke, Essex, and
Salisbury, with the Chatillion of France.]


KING JOHN
Now say, Chatillion, what would France with us?

CHATILLION
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
In my behavior to the majesty,
The borrowed majesty, of England here.

QUEEN ELEANOR
A strange beginning: "borrowed majesty"!

KING JOHN
Silence, good mother. Hear the embassy.

CHATILLION
Philip of France, in right and true behalf
Of thy deceased brother Geoffrey's son,
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories,
To Ireland, Poitiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

KING JOHN
What follows if we disallow of this?

CHATILLION
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

KING JOHN
Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.

CHATILLION
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
The farthest limit of my embassy.

KING JOHN
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace.
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,
For ere thou canst report, I will be there;
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
So, hence. Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.--
An honorable conduct let him have.
Pembroke, look to 't.--Farewell, Chatillion.
