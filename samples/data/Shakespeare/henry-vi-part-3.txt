ACT 1
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Alarum. Enter Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York;
Edward; Richard; Norfolk; Montague; Warwick; and
Soldiers, all wearing the white rose.]


WARWICK
I wonder how the King escaped our hands.

YORK
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slyly stole away and left his men;
Whereat the great lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheered up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front and, breaking in,
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

EDWARD
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerous.
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
[He shows his bloody sword.]

MONTAGUE, [to York, showing his sword]
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encountered as the battles joined.

RICHARD, [holding up a severed head]
Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.

YORK
