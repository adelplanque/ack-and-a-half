INDUCTION
=========

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Beggar (Christopher Sly) and Hostess.]


SLY  I'll feeze you, in faith.

HOSTESS  A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY  You're a baggage! The Slys are no rogues. Look
in the chronicles. We came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore, paucas pallabris, let the world
slide. Sessa!

HOSTESS  You will not pay for the glasses you have
burst?

SLY  No, not a denier. Go, by Saint Jeronimy! Go to
thy cold bed and warm thee.	[He lies down.]

HOSTESS  I know my remedy. I must go fetch the
headborough.	[She exits.]

SLY  Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
by law. I'll not budge an inch, boy. Let him come,
and kindly.	[Falls asleep.]

[Wind horns within. Enter a Lord from hunting, with
his train.]


LORD
Huntsman, I charge thee tender well my hounds.
Breathe Merriman (the poor cur is embossed)
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound!

FIRST HUNTSMAN
Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord.
He cried upon it at the merest loss,
And twice today picked out the dullest scent.
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

LORD
Thou art a fool. If Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well, and look unto them all.
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.
