Scene 1
=======
[Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his mother
the Countess, and Helen, Lord Lafew, all in black.]


COUNTESS  In delivering my son from me, I bury a second
husband.

BERTRAM  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my
father's death anew; but I must attend his Majesty's
command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore
in subjection.

LAFEW  You shall find of the King a husband, madam;
you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you,
whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted
rather than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS  What hope is there of his Majesty's
amendment?

LAFEW  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam,
under whose practices he hath persecuted time

COUNTESS  This young gentlewoman had a father--O,

was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched

the death of the King's disease.

LAFEW  How called you the man you speak of,
madam?

COUNTESS  He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it
was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

LAFEW  He was excellent indeed, madam. The King
very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.
He was skillful enough to have lived still, if
knowledge could be set up against mortality.

BERTRAM  What is it, my good lord, the King languishes
of?

LAFEW  A fistula, my lord.

BERTRAM  I heard not of it before.

LAFEW  I would it were not notorious.--Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

COUNTESS  His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to
my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good
that her education promises. Her dispositions she
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an
