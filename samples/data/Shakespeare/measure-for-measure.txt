Scene 1
=======
[Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords, and Attendants.]


DUKE  Escalus.

ESCALUS  My lord.

DUKE
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you. Then no more remains
But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
[He hands Escalus a paper.]
From which we would not have you warp.--Call
hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
[An Attendant exits.]
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dressed him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power. What think you of it?

ESCALUS
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honor,
It is Lord Angelo.

[Enter Angelo.]


DUKE  Look where he comes.

ANGELO
Always obedient to your Grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE  Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to th' observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched
But to fine issues, nor nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
