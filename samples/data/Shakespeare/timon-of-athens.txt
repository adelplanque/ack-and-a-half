Scene 1
=======
[Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweler, and Merchant, at several
doors.]


POET  Good day, sir.

PAINTER  I am glad you're well.

POET
I have not seen you long. How goes the world?

PAINTER
It wears, sir, as it grows.

POET  Ay, that's well known.
But what particular rarity, what strange,
Which manifold record not matches? See,
Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.

PAINTER  I know them both. Th' other's a jeweler.

MERCHANT, [to Jeweler]
O, 'tis a worthy lord!

JEWELER  Nay, that's most fixed.

MERCHANT
A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness.
He passes.

JEWELER  I have a jewel here--

MERCHANT
O, pray, let's see 't. For the Lord Timon, sir?

JEWELER
If he will touch the estimate. But for that--

POET, [to Painter]
When we for recompense have praised the vile,
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good.
