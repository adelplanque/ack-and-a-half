ACT 1
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt, with other Nobles
and Attendants.]


KING RICHARD
Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,
Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

GAUNT  I have, my liege.

KING RICHARD
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

GAUNT
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aimed at your Highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD
Then call them to our presence.
[An Attendant exits.]
Face to face
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak.
High stomached are they both and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

[Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray.]


BOLINGBROKE
Many years of happy days befall
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege.

MOWBRAY
