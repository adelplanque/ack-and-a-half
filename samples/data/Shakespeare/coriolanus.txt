ACT 1

Scene 1
=======
[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves,
clubs, and other weapons.]


FIRST CITIZEN  Before we proceed any further, hear me
speak.

ALL  Speak, speak!

FIRST CITIZEN  You are all resolved rather to die than to
famish?

ALL  Resolved, resolved!

FIRST CITIZEN  First, you know Caius Martius is chief
enemy to the people.

ALL  We know 't, we know 't!

FIRST CITIZEN  Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at
our own price. Is 't a verdict?

ALL  No more talking on 't; let it be done. Away, away!

SECOND CITIZEN  One word, good citizens.

FIRST CITIZEN  We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians
good. What authority surfeits on would
relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity
while it were wholesome, we might guess they
relieved us humanely. But they think we are too
dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our
misery, is as an inventory to particularize their
abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let
us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for
bread, not in thirst for revenge.

SECOND CITIZEN  Would you proceed especially against
Caius Martius?

ALL  Against him first. He's a very dog to the
commonalty.

SECOND CITIZEN  Consider you what services he has
done for his country?

FIRST CITIZEN  Very well, and could be content to give
him good report for 't, but that he pays himself
with being proud.

SECOND CITIZEN  Nay, but speak not maliciously.
