Scene 1
=======
[Enter Leonato, Governor of Messina, Hero his daughter,
and Beatrice his niece, with a Messenger.]


LEONATO, [with a letter]  I learn in this letter that Don
Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.

MESSENGER  He is very near by this. He was not three
leagues off when I left him.

LEONATO  How many gentlemen have you lost in this
action?

MESSENGER  But few of any sort, and none of name.

LEONATO  A victory is twice itself when the achiever
brings home full numbers. I find here that Don
Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young
Florentine called Claudio.

MESSENGER  Much deserved on his part, and equally
remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself
beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure
of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how.

LEONATO  He hath an uncle here in Messina will be
very much glad of it.

MESSENGER  I have already delivered him letters, and
there appears much joy in him, even so much that
joy could not show itself modest enough without a
badge of bitterness.

LEONATO  Did he break out into tears?

MESSENGER  In great measure.

LEONATO  A kind overflow of kindness. There are no
faces truer than those that are so washed. How
much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at
weeping!

BEATRICE  I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned
from the wars or no?

MESSENGER  I know none of that name, lady. There
was none such in the army of any sort.

LEONATO  What is he that you ask for, niece?

HERO  My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

MESSENGER  O, he's returned, and as pleasant as ever
he was.
