Scene 1
=======
[Enter Justice Shallow, Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans.]


SHALLOW  Sir Hugh, persuade me not. I will make a
Star-Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir
John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow,
Esquire.

SLENDER  In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace
and Coram.

SHALLOW  Ay, Cousin Slender, and Custalorum.

SLENDER  Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born,
Master Parson, who writes himself "Armigero"
in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation--
"Armigero!"

SHALLOW  Ay, that I do, and have done any time these
three hundred years.

SLENDER  All his successors gone before him hath
done 't, and all his ancestors that come after him
may. They may give the dozen white luces in their
coat.

SHALLOW  It is an old coat.

SIR HUGH  The dozen white louses do become an old
coat well. It agrees well, passant. It is a familiar
beast to man and signifies love.

SHALLOW  The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an
old coat.

SLENDER  I may quarter, coz.

SHALLOW  You may, by marrying.

SIR HUGH  It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

SHALLOW  Not a whit.

SIR HUGH  Yes, py 'r Lady. If he has a quarter of your
coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John
Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you,
I am of the Church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compromises
between you.

SHALLOW  The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.

SIR HUGH  It is not meet the Council hear a riot. There
is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you,
shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear
a riot. Take your visaments in that.
